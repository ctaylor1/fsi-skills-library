# Fund service-provider oversight review

Calculate observed fund-service failure rates against supplied SLAs and review assurance expiry and unresolved issue aging. Use for administrator, custody and transfer-agent oversight evidence; no provider approval, assurance opinion or issue closure.

## Supported methods

- `service_oversight`: Compute failures/observations and compare exact failures to threshold times observations. Zero observations yield unavailable rate. Preserve assurance expiry/conclusion and age open issues against supplied due dates; supplied closed issues require closure evidence.

## Workflow

1. Triage the actual job, object, measurement period, currency, vehicle and accountable practitioner. Read [schema](references/schema.md) before collecting data. This package is development software awaiting institutional acceptance.
2. For investigation, reconcile the supplied source records and version/economic/known-at dates using [source map](references/source-map.md). Preserve unknowns and upstream issues. Do not construct missing facts to make an input validate.
3. Apply [domain rules](references/domain-rules.md). Run `python3 -B scripts/validate_input.py INPUT.json`, then `python3 -B scripts/calculate_or_transform.py INPUT.json`. The native scripts consume supplied JSON; they do not connect to enterprise systems.
4. Validate with `python3 -B scripts/validate_output.py OUTPUT.json --input INPUT.json`. Retain the detached original in approved storage. Validation binds the full input and configuration; it does not authenticate evidence, approve methodology or grant action authority.
5. Review calculations, unavailable measures and exceptions with the responsible professional under [controls](references/controls.md). Use the separate [output template](assets/output-template.md) for narrative; do not add it to native JSON. Route unresolved specialist jobs using [handoffs](references/handoffs.md), retaining the source-bound result and original-input reference.
6. Re-run after any source/rule/version/cutoff change. Return to triage if the request exceeds the documented method. A successful calculation is a workpaper, not completion of the downstream workflow.

## Boundaries and validation

This is fund-service observation analysis, not enterprise vendor onboarding, SOC audit opinion, material outsourcing determination, procurement or incident remediation. A clean supplied assurance conclusion cannot close open issues.

The [eval manifest](evals/evals.json) includes executable native goldens/negative cases and declarative trigger, routing, source and authority evaluations. Independent domain regressions supplement reconstruction checks. Natural-language evaluation, actual source authentication, domain SME/control review, accessibility, legal/model review where applicable and deployment acceptance remain separate gates. No posting, trading, payment, investor acceptance, external delivery or system-of-record change occurs.
